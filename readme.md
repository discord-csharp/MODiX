# MODiX - A moderation and analysis bot for discord

MODiX is a moderation and analysis bot for discord. As for now, it just deals with moderation, but development should be driven towards analytics to reach our goal in the near future.

## Roadmap & Contributions

Issues are the center of MODiX´s development. You can see what features are being worked on in the issues and you can see which features are planned. You might also create issues to share problems/ideas. 

## Getting Started

1. Download and install the latest version of the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
2. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker).
3. Create a new [Discord application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) with a bot user.
4. Create the following environment variables for your user account:
    - **DiscordClientId**: the client ID for your Discord app.
    - **DiscordClientSecret**: the client secret for your Discord app.
    - **DiscordToken**: the token for your Discord bot user.
5. Open a browser and navigate to https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&permissions=0&client_id=<Client ID>, replacing `<Client ID>` with your Discord app's client ID from the previous step.
6. Select a Discord server from the dropdown list to add your bot to.

## REPL

Since we get a lot of "questions" regarding this, I think at that point, I should make some kind of statement about it.

Thanks to the cooperation of Cisien, we managed to get a REPL up and running. Aim was to keep it as open and flexible as possible while keeping the response & execution times as low as possible. We just had to restrict some namespaces and classes to minimize the risk of abuse and we were good. 

Here is how its done:
1. Modix receives !exec-Message
2. Modix parses message, sends a HTTP Post-Request to Cisiens API
3. Cisiens API filters some bad namespaces/types, then compiles and executes the code
4. Cisiens API returns a JSON string which contains the results and some metadata
5. Modix wraps the result into a structure using JsonConvert<>
6. Modix returns the results to discord

Why we do it that way:
- Complete seperation between evaluation and discord bot
- Sandboxed environment for script execution
- Eliminating the risk of some compilation/execution crashing Modix
- Azure function restarts itself automagically when it crashes

> Thats not how you should do it

It works fine so far.

> You shouldn´t run a public REPL

We had no serious abuse after running it for almost 14 days.

> Running it in the executing assembly would be way faster

And also result in REPL-Sessions that can potentially crash the bot.
